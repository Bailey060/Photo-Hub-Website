A list of PHP scripts i used to make this work. 

Upload Page:
Firstly, i worked on creating a simple page that allowed me to go into the files of my PC and select any PNG or JPEG file to upload.

<h2>Upload an Image</h2> //Main upload button
    <div class="upload-form"> 
        <form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data"> //These 3 lines make up the script that allows me to upload the photo
            <input type="file" name="image" accept="image/*" required><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Upload">
        </form>
    </div>
    <div class="nav">
        <a href="gallery.php">View Gallery</a> //Navigates you to the gallery page when the "View Gallery" button is pressed
    </div>
</body>
</html>


Photo Checker:
I then created a simple script that checks the photo or image uploaded is suitable for the type of images and space i have. I didnt want images to take up too much space, therefore i 
limited it to 5MB of max size of a file, i then ensured the file would only be uploaded if it was of the following file types in the description below. This was done to ensure that space wouldnt be taken up by bigger file types of photos.

<?php
$targetDir = "uploads/";
$targetFile = $targetDir . basename($_FILES["image"]["name"]);
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($targetFile, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

// Check if file is a real image
$check = getimagesize($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"]);
if ($check === false) {
    die("File is not an image.");
}

// Max size: 5MB
if ($_FILES["image"]["size"] > 5000000) { //Checks the files max size doesnt go over the preset size, if it does it prints an error
    die("Sorry, your file is too large.");
}

// Allowed file types
$allowed = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif']; //Checks that the image is in any one of these formats 
if (!in_array($imageFileType, $allowed)) {
    die("Only JPG, JPEG, PNG & GIF files are allowed.");
}

// Save the file, saves it to the upload file within the server
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"], $targetFile)) {
    echo "The file " . htmlspecialchars(basename($_FILES["image"]["name"])) . " has been uploaded.<br>";
    echo "<a href='index.php'>Upload another</a> | <a href='gallery.php'>View Gallery</a>";
} else {
    echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
}
?>



Gallery Page:

    <h2>Image Gallery</h2>

    <div class="nav">
        <a href="index.php">Upload More</a> // This button takes you back to the Upload page of the website
    </div>

    <div class="gallery">
        <?php
        $dir = "uploads/";
        $images = array_diff(scandir($dir), array('.', '..'));

        foreach ($images as $image) {
            $imagePath = "uploads/$image";
            echo "<a href='$imagePath' target='_blank'>
                    <img src='$imagePath'>
                  </a>";
        }
        ?>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
